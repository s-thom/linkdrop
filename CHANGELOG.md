## [Unreleased](https://github.com/s-thom/linkdrop/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/s-thom/linkdrop/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2022-04-24

### Added

- Login with email/password.
- Form to save links with descriptions and tags.
- Page to search for previously saved links by tag.
- Page to view an individual link.
  - Note: this page is publicly accessible, so you can share it. The randomness of the ID _should_ make it private enough.

### Removed

- Ability to sign up, since this is a personal project.  
  If you're interested in using this, then there are two main options:
  1. Host it yourself. The [default instructions](https://github.com/remix-run/blues-stack#deployment) should get you most of the way, but I may write something proper up later.
  2. If you know me IRL, then ask me about it.
